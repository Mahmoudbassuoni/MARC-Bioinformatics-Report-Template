# LaTeX Document Repository

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for [Document Title or Description]. The document is structured as an academic paper/report and includes sections such as Introduction, Methodology, Results, and References.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `main.tex`: The main LaTeX file.
- `Chapters/`: Directory containing individual chapters or sections.
- `Figures/`: Directory containing figures and images used in the document.
- `references.bib`: BibTeX file containing the bibliography.

## Compilation

To compile the document into a PDF, you will need a LaTeX distribution such as TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX. The document can be compiled using the following sequence of commands:

```bash
pdflatex main
bibtex main
pdflatex main
pdflatex main
```

This sequence compiles the document, processes the bibliography, and ensures all references are correctly included.

Dependencies
The document relies on several LaTeX packages, which are listed in the preamble of main.tex. These packages should be included in most LaTeX distributions by default. Key packages include:

graphicx: For including images.
fancyhdr: For custom headers and footers.
natbib: For bibliography management.
xcolor: For colored text and lines.
Customization
You can customize the document by editing main.tex and the respective chapters in the Chapters/ directory. Images and figures can be replaced or added in the Figures/ directory, and references can be updated in the references.bib file.
